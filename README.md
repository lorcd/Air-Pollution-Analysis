# Air-Pollution-Analysis
We created a realistic but artificial air pollution hourly time-series dataset based on available data for the city of London. Fields we included were pollutants NO₂ and PM₂.₅ measurements, heart rate, respiratory rate, and running pace. We were then able to analyse time-series of pollutants and how they affect health.
