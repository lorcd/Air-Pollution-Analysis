# Air-Pollution-Analysis
We created a realistic but artificial air pollution hourly time-series dataset based on available data for the city of London. Fields we included were pollutants NO₂ and PM₂.₅ measurements, heart rate, respiratory rate, and running pace. We were then able to analyse time-series of pollutants and how they affect health.

# Explanation of Files
The analysis all takes place in the notebook analysis.ipynb. The summary of findings are in both the 1-page report and the presentation.

# Conclusions and Recomendations
In short synopsis, we were able to find peak times, seasons, and routes. We were also able to map how these could be linked to health metrics. To reduce exposure, individuals should avoid peak pollution hours, choose cleaner routes, and use air quality apps. Policymakers can expand low-emission zones, regulate industrial pollution, and promote green urban planning. Increased air quality monitoring and public awareness will further support informed decision-making.
